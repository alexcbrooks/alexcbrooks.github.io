I am a Data Scientist and Water Resource Scientist with over a decade of experience leveraging spatial and environmental datasets to drive effective resource management and conservation. I am skilled in hydro-analytics, modeling, remote sensing, spatial analysis, data visualization, web-tool development using R, GIS, Google Earth Engine and Python. I also have a proven track record in translating complex scientific information into actionable insights for natural resource planning. 

My recent work has focused on wide range of projects, including watershed planning, climate risk assessments, water quality forecasting, project prioritization and evaluation, and river-floodplain connectivity.
