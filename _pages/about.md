I am a Data Scientist and Water Resource Scientist with over a decade of experience leveraging spatial and environmental datasets to drive effective resource management and conservation. I am skilled in hydro-analytics, modeling, remote sensing, spatial analysis, data visualization, web-tool development using R, GIS, Google Earth Engine and Python. I also have a proven track record in translating complex scientific information into actionable insights for natural resource planning. 

My recent work has focused on wide range of projects, including watershed planning, climate risk assessments, water quality forecasting, project prioritization and evaluation, and river-floodplain connectivity.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
